## Project Description
Nowadays, we are facing different frauds in our life. Especially in the rapid changing generation, 
we may use different online applications such as online shopping.
During these shopping processes, we may suffer from lots of fraud risks and we should find some ways to protect our benefit and prevent to become victim. 
However, most of people may not have enough knowledge or experience to prevent some frauds. 
We may just believe the comment or impression or history record.
Actually, we may go online shopping oftenly during our daily life and sometimes we may go to various online shops including platform, social group/marketplace like facebook. 
However, we can't really protect our benefit in the small shops or on social group or individual sellers. 
We may suffer from the risks:
### Risks/Pain Points
1. buying fake products/ low quality products.
2. lose our money (can't receive products)

Hence, how can we make the trust of the sellers online ?
no ideas? only go shopping with famous or reliable platform?

why don't we utilize the security of bitcoin to increase the truth from the sellers
Therefore, the project will develop an innovative concept to let seller can gain more truth via bitcoin staking feature. Moreover, the bitcoin holder can prower up the bitcoin's value to use it earn more from each transaction on honest seller who is your staking target. 

### solution:
1. seller marketplace: can sell their products (start from second-hand products/marketplace)
2. staker function: who believe seller is reliable, they can stake some tokens on honest seller
3. earning commission: staker can earn some commission when the transction completed
4. anti-fraud system: 
* when seller is doing fraud, all tokens will be exposed and any one can get it
* when seller is reported as fraud, all tokens will be locked
5. report and reward function: if someone can discover the fraud and report it, they can get some token from dishonest seller when the case is true.

### impact:
1. let more people know what is web3 and can enjoy wbe3 application
2. increase the bitcoin power and utilize bitcoin's security feature. 
3. public can believe the seller who gain more stake
4. public can be protected when the fraud is happened
5. real decentrallize shopping platform
6. self-discipline: seller need to gain more stake in order to build good reputation
7. public monitoring: don't need specific third party to check seller, and it can let public to monitor

## Project Summary
This project aims to develop a decentrallize shopping platform for individual second hand market 
in order to build a reliable regulations to increase the security of online shopping.
In current situation, we can not find a perfect way to protect our benefit from online shopping. 
online shopping in reliable platform can decrease the risk of the lost, 
also it means you should better go to specific reliable platform such as amazon to decrease the issue.
However, you still suffer from the risk for unhonest seller. 
Therefore, this project will utilize the bitcoin staking strategy to let more monitors to stake their token 
to join the monitoring process
and earn income from each transaction. At same time, they may suffer from the risk of fraud seller. 
so, they need to keep check 
the seller behaviour. When they think the seller is unhonest, they can unbond. 
For the buyer, they can analyse the risk based on the record and the staker situation.
